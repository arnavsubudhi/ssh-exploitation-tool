# SSH Exploitation Tool

 The SSH exploitation tool is a cybersecurity utility designed to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in SSH (Secure Shell) services. The tool automates the process of brute-forcing SSH credentials,
 detecting weak or default passwords, and leveraging identified vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to  remote systems. It leverages the `pwntools` and `paramiko` libraries to perform the attack.
